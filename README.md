# Network Vulnerability Scanner

A Bash script that uses Nmap to scan a target for open ports and known vulnerabilities, generating a summary report of the findings. This project is the culmination of the Shell Scripting course.

## Features

* Accepts a target IP address or hostname from the command line.
* Performs an Nmap scan to detect services and versions.
* (Coming soon) Uses NSE scripts to check for specific vulnerabilities.
* (Coming soon) Generates a formatted report summarizing open ports and potential risks.
* Includes input validation and prerequisite checks.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need the following installed:
* Bash (v4+)
* Nmap (v7.60+)

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/my_scanner.git`
2.  Navigate to the directory: `cd my_scanner`
3.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x network_scanner.sh`
4.  Run the script with a target:
./network_scanner.sh <target_ip_or_hostname>

Example:
./network_scanner.sh scanme.nmap.org

## Ethical Considerations
This tool is for educational purposes only. Only run scans against hosts and networks for which you have explicit, written permission. Unauthorized network scanning is illegal.
